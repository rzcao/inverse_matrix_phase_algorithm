# inverse_matrix_phase_algorithm
The inverse matrix based phase estimation algorithm for the structured illumination microscopy (SIM).

Please read the user's guide (user_guide.pdf) before you use the code for reconstruction in SIM.

If you use the cross-correlation method or the auto-correlation method for the phase estimation, please cite the corresponding reference correctly.

The inverse matrix based phase algorihtm is detailed here:
